Module Objective

This course is fundamental to any computer science curriculum, but it is not just for programmers and computer-science students. Everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensable. Pairwise connections between items play a critical role in a vast array of computational applications. The relationships implied by these connections lead immediately to a host of natural questions: Is there a way to connect one item to another by following the connections? How many other items are connected to a given item? What is the shortest chain of connections between this item and this other item? To model such situations, we use abstract mathematical objects called graphs. In this course, we examine basic properties of graphs in detail, setting the stage for us to study a variety of algorithms that are useful for answering questions of the type just posed.We communicate by exchanging strings of characters. Accordingly, numerous important and familiar applications are based on processing strings. We consider classic algorithms for addressing the underlying computational challenges surrounding applications
Learning Outcomes

How does your Google maps software works? How does it show you the way? Any idea? It is the Graph data structure inside.

Operating system. You know schedulers. Donâ€™t you? Besides implementing nice policy, what if it wastes a lot of time deciding on the task just because you organized the data in a wrong way.

The fundamental design, analysis, and implementation of graph, string data structures.

To develop skills to apply appropriate data structures in problem solving.

Basic concepts in the specification and analysis of programs.

Principles for good program design, especially the uses of data abstraction.
