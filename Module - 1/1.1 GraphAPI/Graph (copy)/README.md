Implement Undirected Graph API, Print adjacency list representation of Graph.

Input Format :
First line of input contains number of Vertices.
Second line of input contains number of Edges.
Third line contains the state names which are separated by comma.
From fourth line onwards, each line contains two vertices (Integers) separated by space, that indicates the cities are to be connected. (The number of edges indicates the number of lines.)

Output Format:
First line contains count of vertices, count of Edges.
From second line, print the city name in given order of city names and its adjacent city names separated by colon. A comma with space to separate adjacent cities.


Note : Use Bag.java to store adjacent vertices, to print them in output order.
