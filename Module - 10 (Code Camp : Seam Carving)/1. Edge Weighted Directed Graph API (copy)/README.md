Implement the API defined for the DirectedEdge and EdgeWeightedDiGraph

Input Format:
First line contains integer V number of Edges.
Second line contains integer E number of Edges.
From third line onwards, each line contains two vertices and weight separated by space, which are to be connected in Graph.
 
Output Format:
Print the edges wrt to all vertices.

Note: Use Bag.java to print the output as per order.
