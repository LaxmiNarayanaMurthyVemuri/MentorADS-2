Can the vertices of a given graph be assigned one of two colors in such a way that no edge connects vertices of the same color? Bipartite uses depth-first search to determine whether a graph has a bipartition; if so, print "Graph is bipartite" if not, "Graph is not a bipartite".

Input Format :
First line of input contains number of Vertices.
Second line of input contains number of Edges.
From third line onwards, each line contains two vertices separated by space, which are to be connected in Undirected Graph.

Output Format:
Either Graph is bipartite or Graph is not a bipartite


Note : Use Bag.java to store adjacent vertices, to print them in output order.
