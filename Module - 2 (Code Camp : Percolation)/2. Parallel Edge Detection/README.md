Parallel edge detection. Devise a linear-time algorithm to count the parallel edges in a graph.
Hint: maintain a boolean array of the neighbors of a vertex, and reuse this array by only reinitializing the entries as needed. 

Input Format :
First line of input contains number of Vertices.
Second line of input contains number of Edges.
From third line onwards, each line contains two vertices separated by space, which are to be connected in Undirected Graph.

Output Format:
print the count of the parallel edges in graph

Note : Use Bag.java to store adjacent vertices, to print them in output order.
